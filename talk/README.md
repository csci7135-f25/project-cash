# project/talk

- We built the slides with [slidev](https://sli.dev/)
    - this presentation lives in `./cash/`
    - we exported the slides to `./cash/Cumulative_Semantics_Presentation.pptx`
    - to run the web view of the presentation (the version shown in class) you will need to
        + install npm dependencies -> `npm install`
        + run slidev with `slidev` or `npm run dev`
