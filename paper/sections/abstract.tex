% problem statement
Cumulative abstract semantics provides a promising solution to the expression problem, but is still an underdeveloped theory.
% why is it interesting
The reusability that this framework provides has the potential to lower the time and cost of creating abstract interpreters, as well as facilitating reuse of research.
% why is it hard
Syntax and semantics are inherently intertwined and difficult to define in isolation. Thereby an analyzer is forced to fuse the syntax, control flow directionality, and abstract domain.
% what is our contribution
We build on cumulative abstract semantics as a theory.
Our previous work constrained cumulative semantics to effect systems, we lift our theory to any higher ordered language. 
Demonstrating the decomposition of syntax and introduction of semantics do not require an a priori effect system, but can be expressed with type classes and continuations.
% what did we do
We also provide a formalization of this framework, as well as two implementations in different languages for concrete interpretation to demonstrate it's scalability and use.
% what did we conclude
We found that there was not a performance impact between the two languages, and neither us too much of a performance cost. 
We proved that this is indeed a valid framework, but it still requires more work to be done.
